Since they have asked us to find the centre of the star graph,

A star graph looks like this

                                A
                                |
                           E--- B ---C
                                |
                                D

So the centre of the universe here becomes B
<h1> B is the centre </h1>
<i>But how to find that?</i>

One way can be to build an actual graph and check one-by-one that which vertex has n-1 edges

Another can be like if a single edge is connected to all the others, that means it is being repeated in the edges array <i>(HINT : HASHSET)</i>

Both the solutions are being provied in Solution.java, and in Optimised.java
