Hi! 👋 I'm **Krishan Kumar Sah**, a passionate developer honing my skills through daily LeetCode challenges. This repository is my personal collection of solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented primarily in **Java**. I aim to solve problems regularly, focusing on clean, efficient code with explanations for different approaches (e.g., brute-force vs. optimized).

Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or just want to practice algorithms, feel free to explore, fork, or contribute! Solutions are organized for easy navigation - both by problem ID and by topic.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repo is divided into two main directories:

- **Serial OrderWise/**: Solutions grouped by LeetCode problem ID (e.g., `LeetCode 01 - Two Sum`). Each folder contains one or more `.java` files, often including brute-force and optimized implementations.
- **Topic Wise/**: Solutions categorized by algorithm topics (e.g., `Greedy`, `Linked List`). This helps with targeted practice.

Additional files:
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for open usage.
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD setups (e.g., automated README updates).

| **Recursion and Backtracking** | (e.g., 17) | 1 `.java` file |
| **Stacks** | (e.g., 20) | 1 `.java` file |
| **Trees** | (Coming soon!) | 0 (placeholder) |
<!-- END TOPICS TABLE -->

This section will expand as I solve more problems across topics like Arrays, Trees, Graphs, DP, and more.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/krishhn13/My-LeetCode.git
   cd My-LeetCode
   ```

2. **Run a Solution** (e.g., Two Sum):
   - Navigate to `Serial OrderWise/LeetCode 01 - Two Sum/`.
   - Compile: `javac Optimised.java`
   - Run: `java Solution` (add your main method or use an IDE like IntelliJ/VS Code for testing).

3. **IDE Recommendations**: Use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions for easy debugging.

4. **Testing**: Each solution includes the standard LeetCode `Solution` class. Test with sample inputs from the problem statements.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to:
- Add solutions in other languages (e.g., Python, C++).
- Suggest optimizations or fixes.
- Propose new topics/folders.

Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
