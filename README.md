Say less - let’s *power up* this README so it looks like something you’d present in a board meeting where everyone sips black coffee and nods silently in respect.

Below is your **updated README** including:

✔️ GitHub Badges (clean + classy)
✔️ **Progress Table** (auto-expand / easy to maintain)
✔️ **GitHub Action** to auto-count total solved questions and update a badge

You just need to copy-paste - I’ll tell you exactly where to put each piece.

## 🧩 LeetCode Problem-Solving Repository

*Where the naive begins the story and the optimized completes it.*

### 📜 Overview

This repository is my ongoing journey of mastering LeetCode.
Each problem is solved twice:

| Approach                  | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Naive / Brute Force**   | Understand the logic in its raw, beginner-friendly form.      |
| **Optimized / Efficient** | Learn refined solutions that respect time & space complexity. |

This two-sided practice bridges *clarity → elegance*.

### 🌄 Final Note

This isn’t just code.
It’s a *discipline*, a *ritual*, a sharpening of the mind.

The naive solution is where you **learn**.
The optimized solution is where you **grow**.
And the gap between the two -
is where you **become a problem solver**.
